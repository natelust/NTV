### version 0.1.2 ###
nate lust: 	removed arbitrary plot labels, and updated readme

### version 0.2 ###
nate lust: 	created changelog
		updated the minimap preview to reflect current scale appropriately
		updated manifest.in to include changelog
		Fixed issue where multiple button presses would create problems when picking star
		Fixed issue with details view generation, occationally a float division error was
			being generated when the fitgaussian function was failing
		Added the ability to change the aperature size and annulus size from within the 
			dialog box by clicking and draging the positions.
		Fixed a bug where the background value was not being subtracted out of the photometry
		TO DO: still need to get color map correct
### version 0.3 ###
nate lust:	Fixed a bug where you could set aperature diameter or annulus diameter to less than
			zero.
		Using the open functions of the drag and drop features from embeded mode should now
			work, please test
		Created a fits header viewer, invoke it with file header or ctl-h, needs a bit of work
			for justifying the text
		Updated the color pallet to be a bit more pleasing on eyes
		Updated the centering in details view to a two step process, first find maximum pixel
			in the cut size, recut based on that max position to ensure the fitgaussian
			sees and fits appropriately
		Put together three D support, still need to impliment playback support
		Updated comments in code
		Implemented play back support in threeD view window
		Updated Details view to persist, and be nonModal, in order to have more than one open
			at a time. May make it as an option to have them open in same window.
		Fixed constraints and drawing problems in the details view for small arrays.
		Updated details view to better handle small arrays, with small cutsizes
		Updated minimap to handle edge events better, can go out toward edge, where pointer
			will go up to within three pixels of the edge, ie the border of cursor will
			go right to edge.Still need a bit of work with really small arrays
		Updated minimap to scale more appropriately for small arrays, higher scale due to
			smaller cut size, since array is much smaller. Still have a bit of issue with
			the pointer in small minimap.
		Updated spelling in details view.
### current ###
nate lust:	Fixed a bug that was causing a segfault on some machines, when the sleeper theread 
			not being properly terrminated.
		Fixed a bug where if there was a zero or negitive number there was a problem when
			switching to log view due to log of negitive number or zero
		Added vertical and horrizontal cut views to the details dialog box.
		Fixed a bug where the figures in the details view were not being drawn properly when
			a resize event occurs.
		Added a basic about message.
		Implemented preference dialog. The user can now choose the preview size, the origin
			location (when this happens the image is inverted, and the preivew is properly
			inverted as well), the default cutsize for the details view, and wether the
			details view draws over its own window or opens multiple windows.
		Added a y and x cut window, able to be hidden or shown, need to add the ability to draw
			the actual cut
		Updated the color to be more usefull
		Fixed an issue where when you had a resized window, then changed the scaling it would 
			redraw the frame at full size. This now behaives as expected. changing the 
			flux scale now preserves the zoom. This is done by recording the ax limits before
			redraw and resetting the limits after the draw. This gets overridden when loading
			a new frame. 
		Addes the virtical and horrizontal profile view that track the mouse motion. OpenGL can
			be used to accellerate the drawing if pyqt has the qtopengl binding 
		Added a check to the embed class. If the function fails to fork a separate process inorder
			to free the terminal, it should place NTV in a separate thread
		Updated the system executeable to be ntviewer, as the previous ntv had problems with OS X
			in that OS X dose not respect case, and copied the folder NTV over the executeable
		Undid the try statement in embed and replaced it with a stronger if else statement, If
			your not using os x it forks it, else it threads it
		Added the ability to move the mouse in the image frame with the keys, this however is in
			screen pixel scales, may be usefull to have only in image pixel movements
		Fixed fixed the ability to embed NTV now provided by a standalone file called embed.
			to put in your program, call from NTV.embed import embed. This is the embed class
			created and instance and pass arrays with showArray
		Fixed the justification in the header view, had to set the font pitch to fixed
