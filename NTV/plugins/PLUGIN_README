NOTE:

This is almost certainly the wrong place to edit plugins. The plugins are
implemented as subtrees in git. This means that committing is not handled in
the normal way. Almost certainly the better course is to clone the plugin from
it's own git repository and put it in the user plugins location for the
platform you are developing. If you do not know where that is, see the top of
NTV.py which specifies the locations. 

If you are looking to build a new plugin the development should happen in a
separate git repo, and for testing purposes placed in the user plugin
location.

If you are looking to update plugins or distribute new ones, please use the
plugin manager built in the app. If you are looking to have your plugin added
to the application as an addon plugin please put in a pull request on the
plugin manager repository. If you are making a new core plugin, put in a pull
request both in the main application repository, and in the plugin manager
repository, so that the plugin manager will track it.

Note to myself or a future maintainer:
When it comes time for a new release and you want to pull in a new copy of the
plugins at their state issue:

git subtree --prefix=NTV/plugins/<plugin name> <plugin git url> <branch>

where branch is probably master
