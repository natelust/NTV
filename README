This program is an astronomical data viewer. It is my attempt at being a clone to ATV for idl or DS9.
It is missing features and could have some of the ones worked out better, but It is capable of being
used to view fits files, and view properties of selected stars.

In details view, it is possible to select the aperature and annulus positions by dragging the vertical
lines to the desired position. If a three dimentional array is loaded, there will be a window which pops
up to navigate the desired image. There is also a playback function in that window, to play in movie mode.

To install
from the command line run python setup.py install to have it install to the default site packages 
directory.

To run the program you can launch it with ntv from the command line.

This can also be embeded into python interactive session.
When in python,
from NTV.embed import embed()
some_instance_name = embed()

to show an array:
some_instance_name.showArray()

Requirements:
---------------
Numpy
Scipy dependency is depricated I belive, if your setup complains, install it
Scipy >0.7.0 I think, there are some complains about numpy.test, your 
version may work, but mine does with this version.

Matplotlib
astropy
PyQt4
Python > 2.6 OR multiprocessing package installed for embeded mode

Optional:
-----------
Zeromq / python zeromq bindings
